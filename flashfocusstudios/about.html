				<h1>The Photographer: Julio Perez</h1>
				<p>Julio became interested in photography in 2017, he was studying to become a web developer and wanted his own camera to create content for his websites.
				He started off getting the Nikon D5500 kit and started practicing the basics. He is self-taught using youtube as main resource for learning about the basics such as shutter speed, aperature, ISO, and composition. Julio has explored many types of photography such as portraiture, wildlife, landscape and street photography. He realized his true calling was wildlife and hopes to create his own book based on Birds in New Jersey.</p>
